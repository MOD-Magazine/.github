## Contributing

There are a variety of ways to contribute! None of these roles have any
commitment, but we'd prefer if you contacted us on
[Discord](https://mod-magazine.github.io/discord) before making a pull request.

- **Writer**: writing and potentially reviewing articles.
- **Editor**: gathering articles and reviewing them - a more formal role than
  writer.
- **Designer**: helping us with our design, from logo to print.
- **Developer**: contributing to our website.

You can also suggest projects and articles on our
[Discord](https://mod-magazine.github.io/discord), if you don't want to do any
of the above roles but still want to get involved.

If you wish to contribute, please reach out and see `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the main repository.
